#Project Notebook mk. II
I hope you have been taking electronic notes, because in this project we are going to upload these notes onto github using git. 

You should be familiar with setting up your git environment up from the earlier projects in Web Development 101; if not, [refer](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css) to the steps in the Google Homepage project.

##Your Task:
Set up a git environment so that it is possible for you to make changes to your documents locally, and then archive them online on github. You will be using the command line for the majority of this project and should only need to perform a few actions online on github.

Some commands you may use for set up:
* `git init`
* `git add remote origin [url]`
* `git clone [url]`

Commands you will use for your workflow:
* `git add [file]` or `git add .`
* `git commit -m "Your atomic commit message!"`
* `git push origin master`

Commit often: after each study session commit your notes. Hopefully all your commits have been impactful - you would then follow your commit with a push onto github. 

The aim of this project is to help you become familiar with the Git workflow as it is so widely used in software development. As long as you are taking notes, this project is ongoing! Each commit will show you how far you have come in your journey learning. If electronic notes are not your thing, you could choose to commit a diary that outlines what you have learned and achieved each day and and goals for the future.

###Clarity on some terms:
* "git" refers to a program that carries out version control
* "`.git`" refers to a special folder
* "github" refers to a website
